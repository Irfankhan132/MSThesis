# MSThesis
Master of Science in Computer Engineering

I am a Masterâ€™s student in Computer Engineering at the University of Padua, specializing in Knowledge Graph Embeddings for Link Prediction Models as part of my thesis research as well as how we can create a KGs from unstructured data using LLMs. My work focuses on applying machine learning techniques to enhance the representation and reasoning capabilities of knowledge graphs.

With a strong background in Data Modeling, Data Analysis with Python, and AI-driven Graph Applications, I have hands-on experience in integrating Neo4j with Generative AI models to improve information retrieval and decision-making. I am passionate about leveraging KGs, LLMs, and machine learning to solve real-world problems.
